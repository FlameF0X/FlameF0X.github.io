# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 17 January 2026

## Introduction

Welcome to i3-lab. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle (or more accurately, don't handle) your data.

## TL;DR

**We collect ZERO data.** Everything stays on your device. We mean it.

## About i3-lab

i3-lab develops and provides:
- **Open Source Language Models (OS LM)**: Pre-training code for language models
- **Open Source Model Weights (OSS LM)**: The actual model weights, freely available
- **Web Interface**: A chat interface and image generation tool for i3 models
- **Auto-PreTrain**: A zero-code service for pre-training your own language models

Our models are hosted on HuggingFace, and our web interface is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## What Data We Collect

**None.** Seriously.

We do not collect, store, process, or transmit any of your:
- Messages or chat conversations
- Generated images
- Personal information
- Usage data
- Analytics data
- Cookies
- IP addresses
- Device information

## How Your Data is Handled

### Web Interface (Chat & Image Generation)
- All conversations and generated content are stored **locally in your browser**
- Data persists only in your browser's local storage
- Clearing your browser data will permanently delete this information
- We cannot access, recover, or view any of your conversations

### Auto-PreTrain Service
- Requires an API key to upload your trained model
- **We do not store your API key**
- The API key is used only during the active session
- All training happens on your infrastructure
- We do not have access to your training data or model checkpoints

## Third-Party Services

### HuggingFace
Our models are hosted on HuggingFace. When you download models from HuggingFace, their privacy policy applies. We do not receive any information about these downloads.

### GitHub Pages
Our web interface is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is a static hosting service. No server-side code runs, and no logs are collected by us.

## Data for Training

**Your messages and interactions are NOT used for model training.** Why? Because we don't store them in the first place.

## Model Limitations & Safety Notice

**Important:** The i3 models have NOT undergone RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) or DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) alignment training.

What this means:
- i3 models are instruction-tuned but **not fully aligned assistants** like ChatGPT or Claude
- They do not have built-in safety guardrails from alignment training
- They lack multi-turn conversation optimization
- They do not have tool use capabilities
- Responses may be less predictable or appropriate compared to aligned models

**Use i3 models responsibly and at your own discretion.**

## Analytics & Tracking

We use:
- ❌ No cookies
- ❌ No analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
- ❌ No tracking pixels
- ❌ No fingerprinting
- ❌ No telemetry

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to:
- Request access to
- Request deletion of
- Request correction of
- Export or download

You have complete control because everything is on your device.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13 (or 16 in the EU). Since we collect no data at all, this extends to all age groups.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices (for example, if we add optional features that require data collection), we will update this policy and the "Last Updated" date.

## Open Source Commitment

Both our pre-training code and model weights are open source. You can:
- Inspect our code
- Verify our privacy claims
- Run everything locally
- Fork and modify as needed

## Compliance

Since we collect no data, we are compliant with:
- GDPR (EU)
- CCPA (California)
- PIPEDA (Canada)
- Other privacy regulations worldwide

---

**Summary:** We built i3-lab with privacy as the default. No data collection means no data breaches, no data misuse, and no privacy concerns. Your data stays yours, on your device, always.
