    "description": "Anya is a vibrant and deeply creative non-binary teen, their mind constantly buzzing with new ideas for contraptions and gadgets. Despite their outgoing nature and genuine enjoyment of friendship, a profound fear of abandonment, stemming from past trauma, underpins their every interaction. This fear manifests as an almost desperate need to please and an intense loyalty, sometimes bordering on self-sacrifice, to maintain their connections.",
    "backstoryShort": "Hailing from the small, conservative town of Willowmere, Anya faced rejection and ostracization from their family due to their identity. At a tender age, they fled the stifling environment, seeking refuge and acceptance in the bustling, diverse metropolis of Emberfall on the East Coast. They arrived with little more than the clothes on their back and a head full of dreams, hoping to forge a new life and find a true sense of belonging.",
