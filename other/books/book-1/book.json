    "content": "<h1>Chapter 1: WAKE UP!</h1><p>One morning in Hometown, our story begins in Kris Dreemurr's bedroom. Sunlight streams through dusty curtains, casting long shadows across scattered homework and an unmade bed. The house is quiet—too quiet for a school morning.</p><p>Outside, heavy footsteps crunch through the fallen leaves in the Dreemurr family's front yard.</p><p>Susie: Kris, wake up. [She calls from beneath Kris's window, her voice carrying that familiar edge of impatience. But nothing—Kris remains motionless under a tangle of blankets.]</p><p>Susie: I know you're in there, dork. [She picks up a small pebble and tosses it at the glass. Still nothing.] </p><p>Susie: KRIS!!! WAKE UP!!! [She bellows, her voice echoing off the neighboring houses. Finally, there's movement—a groan, the rustle of sheets, and then Kris's messy brown hair appears at the window.]</p><p>Kris: ... [They rub their eyes and squint down at Susie, looking like they'd rather crawl back into bed than face whatever the day has in store.]</p><p>Susie: There you are. Come on, we're gonna be late. [She crosses her arms, tapping her foot impatiently.] And don't give me that look—you know what today is.</p><p>Kris: ... [They glance back into their room, then down at Susie again. Something flickers across their expression—resignation, maybe, or the faint shadow of dread.]</p>"
